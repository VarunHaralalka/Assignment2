    <h1>Kalighat Mandir</h1>
    <p>The term Kalighat originated from the Hindu goddess Kali who resides in the temple, and Ghat (riverbank) where the temple is located.[2]
    </p>
    <p>
        As per mythology, on learning about the death of Sati by self-immolation, Lord Shiva was blinded in rage and started the Tandav Nritya (Dance of Destruction). To prevent the world from eminent destruction, Lord Vishnu used his Sudarshan Chakra to cut the corpse of Sati into 51 pieces, which fell in various places of the Indian subcontinent.[3] Kalighat represents the site where the toes of the right foot of Dakshayani or Sati fell.</p>
