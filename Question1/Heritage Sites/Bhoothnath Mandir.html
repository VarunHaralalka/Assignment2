    <h1>Bhoothnath Mandir</h1>
    <p>Besides the cremation ground at Nimtala Ghat, stands one of the most underrated and ancient temples of the state. Baba Bhootnath Dham is considered as a holy site where all wishes come true and therefore, its also known as Kaamna Poorti Mahadev. The Bhootnath form of Lord Shiva is being worshipped here, which is the pre-Nataraja form of God. Nothing much is known about its origin but all people speak about the 300 years old tradition of worshipping Lord Shiva with the ashes of a burnt body from the cremation ground beside.
